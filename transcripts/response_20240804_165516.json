right\",\"start\":2248.32,\"duration\":4.799},{\"text\":\"like you and I worked at Gmail Google\",\"start\":2250.18,\"duration\":5.46},{\"text\":\"workspace or whatever so that's like

ecosystem\",\"start\":2608.319,\"duration\":4.321},{\"text\":\"so what you can like yeah let's look\",\"start\":2610.359,\"duration\":4.201},{\"text\":\"into Visual Studio run through people\",\"start\":2612.64,\"duration\":3.959},{\"text\":\"using visual studio\",\"start\":2614.56,\"duration\":4.74},{\"text\":\"so you can see no surprise speed

like\",\"start\":2621.52,\"duration\":4.319},{\"text\":\"another area that like automation is you\",\"start\":2623.319,\"duration\":4.981},{\"text\":\"know very growing here so let's see like\",\"start\":2625.839,\"duration\":4.801},{\"text\":\"another data set and that is relevant to\",\"start\":2628.3,\"duration\":4.14},{\"text\":\"developer

yeah\",\"start\":2635.319,\"duration\":4.8},{\"text\":\"you can see business intelligence and\",\"start\":2637.72,\"duration\":4.44},{\"text\":\"then you see again automation anywhere\",\"start\":2640.119,\"duration\":5.401},{\"text\":\"so another RPA so RP is very popular in\",\"start\":2642.16,\"duration\":6.78},{\"text\":\"Azure ecosystem and AWS ecosystem

be\",\"start\":2652.119,\"duration\":3.96},{\"text\":\"like yeah this is like RPA stuff is\",\"start\":2654.04,\"duration\":3.9},{\"text\":\"growing a lot like we should we look\",\"start\":2656.079,\"duration\":4.381},{\"text\":\"into this ecosystem that you might be\",\"start\":2657.94,\"duration\":6.179},{\"text\":\"like okay like I like the RPA idea let's\",\"start\":2660.46,\"duration\":6.78},{\"text\":\"look into robotic process or formation\",\"start\":2664.119,\"duration\":5.301},{\"text\":\"for Enterprise\",\"start\":2667.24,\"duration\":5.22},{\"text\":\"companies so you would start building a\",\"start\":2669.42,\"duration\":5.02},{\"text\":\"thesis and you would start like\",\"start\":2672.46,\"duration\":6.78},{\"text\":\"following this thesis area the ideas\",\"start\":2674.44,\"duration\":6.72},{\"text\":\"and you would look into basically\",\"start\":2679.24,\"duration\":4.44},{\"text\":\"getting like similar companies that are\",\"start\":2681.16,\"duration\":4.08},{\"text\":\"working on it this algorithm takes a\",\"start\":2683.68,\"duration\":2.82},{\"text\":\"little bit of time\",\"start\":2685.24,\"duration\":4.02},{\"text\":\"we will see yeah it would pull some data\",\"start\":2686.5,\"duration\":5.22},{\"text\":\"sets at some companies like that open\",\"start\":2689.26,\"duration\":4.98},{\"text\":\"source robotic solution for okay like\",\"start\":2691.72,\"duration\":4.5},{\"text\":\"outlived AI develop robotic process\",\"start\":2694.24,\"duration\":4.2},{\"text\":\"automation design so you see like these\",\"start\":2696.22,\"duration\":3.72},{\"text\":\"sorts of like companies coming your way\",\"start\":2698.44,\"duration\":2.82},{\"text\":\"and the reason why it takes time is\",\"start\":2699.94,\"duration\":3.3},{\"text\":\"because you y'all are doing it in I\",\"start\":2701.26,\"duration\":4.14},{\"text\":\"believe in beddings and then you're\",\"start\":2703.24,\"duration\":4.079},{\"text\":\"using some llm to put it back together\",\"start\":2705.4,\"duration\":3.419},{\"text\":\"and give you a natural language

improve\",\"start\":2714.16,\"duration\":4.679},{\"text\":\"that we can improve this like with\",\"start\":2716.44,\"duration\":4.74},{\"text\":\"putting this in Pine Cone

to\",\"start\":2723.46,\"duration\":4.08},{\"text\":\"do like the other thing it would be like\",\"start\":2725.079,\"duration\":5.401},{\"text\":\"okay let's do evaluate robotic

successful\",\"start\":2732.339,\"duration\":4.74},{\"text\":\"let's see it said like negative so this\",\"start\":2734.14,\"duration\":4.5},{\"text\":\"is like an another machine

successful\",\"start\":2741.339,\"duration\":4.861},{\"text\":\"companies and unsuccessful companies and\",\"start\":2744.04,\"duration\":4.14},{\"text\":\"trained basically on that so this is\",\"start\":2746.2,\"duration\":5.119},{\"text\":\"like the ID algorithm\",\"start\":2748.18,\"duration\":3.139},{\"text\":\"it's like a homer because there could be\",\"start\":2754.8,\"duration\":4.539},{\"text\":\"people who come out like I think this\",\"start\":2757.66,\"duration\":2.82},{\"text\":\"idea is great I want to spend all those\",\"start\":2759.339,\"duration\":2.52},{\"text\":\"resources and time on it and then it's\",\"start\":2760.48,\"duration\":2.76},{\"text\":\"like your idea was doomed from the\",\"start\":2761.859,\"duration\":2.041},{\"text\":\"beginning\",\"start\":2763.24,\"duration\":2.28},{\"text\":\"and you can at least tell you if your\",\"start\":2763.9,\"duration\":4.439},{\"text\":\"idea is unique or not you need exactly\",\"start\":2765.52,\"duration\":5.28},{\"text\":\"exactly and I can go both ways for

negative\",\"start\":2808.359,\"duration\":5.76},{\"text\":\"I think the the value of this technology\",\"start\":2810.46,\"duration\":5.58},{\"text\":\"like that we have built up like this\",\"start\":2814.119,\"duration\":5.581},{\"text\":\"idea one is the ability to skim through\",\"start\":2816.04,\"duration\":5.819},{\"text\":\"thousands and thousands of ideas and\",\"start\":2819.7,\"duration\":4.02},{\"text\":\"like finding that like true positive\",\"start\":2821.859,\"duration\":4.201},{\"text\":\"among like thousands of like exactly and\",\"start\":2823.72,\"duration\":4.44},{\"text\":\"if it if that would respond saying\",\"start\":2826.06,\"duration\":4.86},{\"text\":\"decision positive I would have said work\",\"start\":2828.16,\"duration\":6.12},{\"text\":\"to do so\",\"start\":2830.92,\"duration\":3.36},{\"text\":\"that's really good so I like okay\",\"start\":2835.2,\"duration\":5.5},{\"text\":\"so ideas we can test this like these\",\"start\":2838.42,\"duration\":4.199},{\"text\":\"hundred ideas maybe it will say one to\",\"start\":2840.7,\"duration\":4.379},{\"text\":\"the positive and again yeah you can work\",\"start\":2842.619,\"duration\":4.381},{\"text\":\"on it let's do investors we have a lot\",\"start\":2845.079,\"duration\":3.421},{\"text\":\"of investors in our group yeah which use\",\"start\":2847,\"duration\":2.46},{\"text\":\"case do you think would be better for\",\"start\":2848.5,\"duration\":2.94},{\"text\":\"our stem investors who are looking to\",\"start\":2849.46,\"duration\":3.3},{\"text\":\"invest in startups like you have the\",\"start\":2851.44,\"duration\":4.08},{\"text\":\"refer feed hot similar which ones do you\",\"start\":2852.76,\"duration\":5.339},{\"text\":\"think would be great I think the most\",\"start\":2855.52,\"duration\":5.22},{\"text\":\"interesting one in my opinion is hot\",\"start\":2858.099,\"duration\":4.381},{\"text\":\"Okay so\",\"start\":2860.74,\"duration\":4.379},{\"text\":\"what this does is it looks into the seat\",\"start\":2862.48,\"duration\":5.04},{\"text\":\"stage companies based on their

the\",\"start\":2878.68,\"duration\":4.1},{\"text\":\"current traffic growth over yeah\",\"start\":2880.3,\"duration\":7.019},{\"text\":\"yeah so me Journey probably last year or\",\"start\":2882.78,\"duration\":5.98},{\"text\":\"like one and a half years ago or\",\"start\":2887.319,\"duration\":3.061},{\"text\":\"something not so much but at the

to\",\"start\":2944.26,\"duration\":3.9},{\"text\":\"write like custom code for that or we\",\"start\":2945.94,\"duration\":4.74},{\"text\":\"have to use gpt4 to write the query
